Simple Python program to allow use of a Color Computer (1,2 or 3) cassette tape cable to a Windows PC. 
Requires a CoCo tape cable.
NOTE: I had to reverse the cable adapters (mic and headphones) between recroding and playing media into the CoCo and both jacks needed to be connected.
Program still in testing.

Requirements:
Windows PC
CoCo tape cable
CoCo (1,2 or3)

Instructions.

Connect your Color Computer tape cable to your PC headphone and microphone jacks.
Start the PyCoCoTape program from either the Windos executable or python script.

To record a progam from the CoCo you may need to swap the Headhone and mic connections on your PC.
The PyCoCoTape console should be showing on your PC with teh optins screen open

Recording.
TO record from the option menu, just the letter [r] (do not includd brakets) and then follow with a file name and press enter. (i.e. rCoCo and press enter and this will start a recorfing a tape named CoCo.) Then execute CSAVE on your CoCo. Once teh CoCO CSAVE is complete. Press [q] on the PC to stop the recording.

Playback.
To playback a tape. You may need to swap the headphone and mic adapters on the PC. Executer a CLOAD on your CoCo. On the PC from the main menu, press [p] and the filen name/ (i.e. pcoco will playback the tape name coco.)

Settings.
It make take some trial and error to get the volume and amplify seetings correct. PC sound systems vary so what works on one PC may not work on another. 

Amplify.
You can change teh amplify setting by typing [a] and a number (i.e. a70). This number could vary greatly depending on the PC. If some case in can be in the thousands.

Volume.
Once you find a s good volume, you can press the [v] key from the main menu and this wil save teh volume setting. This way when you reopen the program it will rembmer the volume settings.

Notes.
This prgrom is stil being tested. I only have one tape cable and one CoCo to test it on. I found it interesteing that I had to swap out the cable for this this to work and each jack needed to be occpied for the program to work proprly.  Not sure if I have a faulty cable or CoCo or maybe user error.
